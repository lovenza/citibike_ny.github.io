# 🚴 Introduction: NYC Citi Bike Ridership Patterns in Response to Daily Rhythms and Weather

Citi Bike has become an integral part of New York City's public transportation network, serving millions of rides. As a data-rich system, it offers a unique opportunity to understand the mobility patterns of a major metropolis.

The goal of this project is to analyze how NYC's population uses the Citi Bike system, focusing on key external factors and usage patterns.

## ❓ Core Research Questions

We will address the following key questions using our 100,000-ride sample from September 2025:

1.  **Temporal Patterns:** How do predictable daily and weekly rhythms (e.g., time of day, weekday vs. weekend) shape ridership?
2.  **User Segmentation:** How do different user groups (members vs. casual riders) use the system differently in terms of trip volume and duration?
3.  **Weather Quantification:** To what extent does daily weather (Max Temperature, Precipitation) influence the decision to ride a bike and the duration of the trip?

## 🛠️ Project Structure and Analysis Pipeline

The website is organized to follow our analytical workflow:

* **[1. Data Wrangling](data_wrangling.html)**: Details our data collection, the **stratified sampling strategy** creating the 100k-ride dataset, cleaning, and merging trip-level data with daily NOAA weather data.
* **[2. EDA & Visualization](EDA.html)**: Presents a comprehensive exploratory analysis of **temporal** (hourly, daily) and **user-type** patterns, including plots demonstrating the relationship between ridership and key weather variables.
* **[3. Statistical Analysis](model_and_spatial_analysis.html)**: Quantifies the specific impact of weather (e.g., effect per 10°F or 1-inch of precipitation) and day-of-week on **individual ride duration** using multivariate linear regression models.
