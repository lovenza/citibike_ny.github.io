## Tentative Project Title

**The Pulse of the City: An Analysis of NYC Citi Bike Ridership Patterns in Response to Daily Rhythms and Weather**

</div>

<div class="info-card">

## Motivation

Citi Bike has become an integral part of New York City's public transportation network, serving millions of rides to commuters, residents, and tourists. As a data-rich system, it offers a unique opportunity to understand the mobility patterns of a major metropolis.

The goal of this project is to analyze how NYC's population uses the Citi Bike system. The aim is to answer these key questions:

+ How do predictable daily and weekly rhythms (e.g., time of day, weekday vs. weekend) shape ridership?  
+ How do different user groups (members vs. casual riders) use the system differently?  
+ To what extent does daily weather (a powerful external factor) influence the decision to ride a bike?  

Understanding these patterns is valuable for urban planning, public health initiatives, and the operational logistics of the bike-share system itself.

## Intended Final Products

The project will be delivered as a comprehensive, integrated website, designed to clearly present our findings and provide a dynamic, hands-on user experience. The site will be organized around the following key components:

**1. Data Processing & Curation:**  
A detailed description of our data sources (Citi Bike System Data and NOAA). This section will explain our data collection process, including our stratified sampling strategy to create a 100,000-ride manageable dataset, and the full cleaning and merging process used to combine trip-level data with daily weather data.

**2. Exploratory Analyses Report:**  
A comprehensive report systematically answering our key research questions about Citi Bike ridership for September 2025. This will include a full analysis of temporal patterns (hourly, daily, weekly), differences in user behavior (member vs. casual), and average trip durations.

**3. Visualization Plots:**  
A collection of static and interactive charts and maps to showcase key trends. This will include:

+ ***Maps:*** Geospatial plots showcasing citywide station density, the most popular start stations, and "flow maps" visualizing the most common routes, with facets by borough and user type.  
+ ***Time-Series Graphs:*** Bar charts showing ridership by hour of the day, faceted by user type and weekday/weekend to reveal commuter peaks.  
+ ***Correlation Plots:*** Scatter plots demonstrating the relationship between total daily rides and key weather variables (e.g., maximum temperature, precipitation).  

**4. Statistical Analysis Report:**  
An illustrative page detailing the statistical methodology, results, and interpretation of our linear regression models. This section will quantify the specific impact of weather (e.g., effect per 10°F or 1-inch of precipitation) and day of the week on daily ridership, comparing these effects for member vs. casual users.

**5. Interactive Dashboard (Shiny Application):**  
An interactive dashboard integrated into the website to "bring the analysis to life." This tool will allow users to dynamically explore the data by filtering ridership maps and charts by user type, time of day, or weather conditions. It will also feature a simple "what-if" prediction widget to estimate ridership based on user-selected inputs.

**6. Two-Minute Screencast:**  
A two-minute narrated screencast embedded on the website, serving as the project's "elevator pitch." This video will concisely summarize the main research questions, highlight the most significant findings, and demonstrate the key features of the interactive dashboard.

**7. Summary & Discussion:**  
A concise summary highlighting our key findings, the main predictors of ridership, and a discussion of the project's limitations and potential future work.

**8. GitHub Repository:**  
A link to the project's complete GitHub repository. The repository will be clearly organized with all code, analysis scripts (R), R Markdown files, and the two datasets (the 100k ride sample and NOAA weather data) to ensure the analysis is fully reproducible.

## Anticipated Data Sources

Successfully acquired and vetted two primary data sources for a focused analysis of September 2025:

**1. Citi Bike Trip Data:**  
Sourced from the official [Citi Bike System Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).  
The full dataset for September 2025 is massive (approx. 5.28 million rides across six files). To ensure computational feasibility while maintaining representative data, we have adopted a sampling strategy:  

  + Selected one of the six files (1 million rides).  
  + Drawn a stratified random sample of 100,000 rides, ensuring all 30 days of September are proportionately represented.  
  + This 100k-ride sample (`202509-citibike-tripdata_3.csv`) will serve as our primary dataset for trip-level analysis.

**2. NYC Weather Data:**  
Sourced from the [NOAA Climate Data Online portal](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/). We downloaded daily weather summaries for September 2025 from the Central Park station (ID: USW00094728). This file (`noaa_central_park_2025.csv`) contains key predictive variables: **TMAX**, **TMIN**, and **PRCP**.

**3. Rationale for Choosing September 2025:**  
September provides moderate weather, avoiding extremes that suppress ridership, while still showing natural variability (rain, cool snaps). It captures post-summer "back-to-work" and "back-to-school" rhythms, ideal for observing weekday–weekend contrasts. Moreover, using ***2025 data*** ensures the study reflects post-pandemic mobility patterns and the Citi Bike system's expanded coverage.

## Anticipated Coding Challenges

This project anticipates three main coding challenges:

**1. Data Aggregation and Merging:**  
Citi Bike data (trip level) and NOAA data (daily level) must be aligned by date.  
Accurately aggregating trips into daily summaries (e.g., total rides, mean duration) is essential.

**2. Spatial Data Visualization:**  
Creating meaningful "flow maps" of routes requires precise handling of latitude/longitude data and specialized mapping packages.

**3. Shiny Application Reactivity:**  
Ensuring the dashboard updates smoothly based on multiple user inputs demands efficient, reactive server-side code.

## Planned Analyses and Visualizations

The analysis will be structured to address our core research questions, progressing from data wrangling to modeling.

**1. Data Wrangling:**  
  + Clean the 100,000-ride sample, creating derived variables (trip duration, hour, day of week).  
  + Clean NOAA data, convert units (e.g., tenths °C → °F), handle missing values.  
  + Aggregate trip data by date and join with daily weather data.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization:**  
  + ***Time Patterns:*** Plot hourly ridership to reveal rush-hour peaks and compare by user type and weekday/weekend.  
  + ***Spatial Patterns:*** Map top 50 start stations and visualize top 100 routes to identify key corridors.  
  + ***Weather Impact:*** Create scatterplots showing the relationship between daily rides and temperature/precipitation.

**3. Statistical Modeling:**  
  + Fit a multivariate linear regression model.  
  + ***Outcome:*** total daily rides.  
  + ***Predictors:*** TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, and day of week.  
  + Interpret coefficients to quantify how each weather factor affects ridership.
